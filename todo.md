- [] migrate to use interpreter
- [] make operator to have lower precedence, dot to have higher precedence ?
- [] better syntax for CPS, example ~async(getFoo ! + (getBar !))

- [x] use #{} for record
- [x] use #() for array
- [x] use square braket instead of backtick for quoted identifier (improve readability)

- [] use back curly bracket for record
- [] type casting
- [x] constrained polymorphism
- [x] cps sugar
- [x] raw string literal with variable length quotes
