  = The first parameter type of this function is a record that has a property also named 'name'.
    Suppose we have an expression x that has the first paramter type, then the expression below is ambiguous:

        x.name

    This is ambiguous because we will not know if it meant to call the 'name' function or to access the property 'name'.
    Therefore, to prevent such ambiguity, such function definition is disallowed.
