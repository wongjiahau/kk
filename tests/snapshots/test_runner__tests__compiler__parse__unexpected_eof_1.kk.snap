error:
  ┌─ tests/compiler/parse/unexpected_eof_1.kk:1:7
  │
1 │ let f = (x: Int)
  │       ^ Syntax error: not expecting `=` here
  │
  = The expected token here is `:`.

    Note that `=` is used for declaring variables locally, for example:

    let x = 1.

    We found this error when we are trying to parse a Let Statement.
    Examples of Let Statement are:

    Example #1:

      let x : Integer = 1

    Example #2:

      let identity = <T>(t: T): T => t
